## 1. Overview

[if condition='q#120="Employer" || q#120="Medical/Dental Provider"']Covered Entities and their [/if]Business Associates must create HIPAA Policies and Procedures (“Policies and Procedures”) with respect to [if condition='q#120="Employer Group" || q#120="Medical/Dental Provider"']Protected Health Information (PHI)[/if][if condition='q#120="Agency" || q#120="Business Associate"']Protected Data[/if] that are designed to comply with the standards and implementation specifications under 45 CFR § 164.530(i)(1). They must change their Policies and Procedures as necessary and appropriate to comply with changes in the law, including the standards, requirements, and implementation specifications of § 164.530(i)(2)(i).

‘CFR’ stands for the Code of Federal Regulations, which are divided into 50 broad areas (‘titles’), and subject to government regulations. ‘45’ is the Public Welfare title and includes the principal set of rules and regulations issued by federal agencies regarding public welfare. ‘§’ stands for Section. ‘45CFR’ will be implied and not repeated in future citations.

## 2. Scope
Implementing HIPAA compliance is not only important to protect [if condition='q#120="Agency"']client[/if][if condition='q#120="Employer Group" || q#120="Business Associate"']employee[/if][if condition='q#120="Medical/Dental Provider"']patient[/if] information entrusted to [q#2] but also safeguards $the_noun($possessive([q#3])) business intelligence. This document defines control processes and procedures that will help [q#2] comply with federal regulations and policies[if condition='q#120="Employer"'], including ERISA,[/if] in addition to HIPAA and cites the Policies and Procedures $the_noun([q#3]) has put in place to protect all private, internal, and protected information.

## 3. Definitions

_**Business Associate (BA)**:_ An entity that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits Protected Health Information on behalf of a Covered Entity.

_**Business Associate Subcontractor (BAS)**:_ An entity that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits Protected Health Information on behalf of another Business Associate. (Business Associate and Business Associate Subcontractor are often used interchangeably.)

_**Covered Entity**:_ A health plan, a healthcare clearinghouse, or a healthcare provider who transmits and PHI in electronic form in connection with a transaction.

_**Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)**:_ Refers to PHI that is covered under HIPAA security regulations and is produced, saved, transferred, or received in an electronic form.[if condition='q#7>=1']

_**Employees**:_ Staff, volunteers, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for $a_an([q#3]), is under the direct control of such an entity, whether or not they are paid by $the_noun([q#3]). This includes full- and part-time staff, affiliates, associates, volunteers, and staff from third parties who provide service to $the_noun([q#3]). For the purposes of this document, an employee is anyone in [q#2] who has access or potential access to [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if].[/if]

Outdated and superseded materials from the SDL will be kept in the Security Documentation Archive for at least six years after the date when they are first outdated or superseded. (§§ 164.316(b)(1) and (2))

# II. Preface and Background Material
## 1. Overview
It is vital to the reputation and profitability of [if condition='q#120="Employer" || q#120="Medical/Dental Provider"']Covered Entities and their [/if]Business Associates that information, in all forms, be protected from unauthorized use, modification, loss, copying, etc. This document sets out the default standards which must be met to ensure that the [q#3] is compliant with HIPAA[if condition='q#120="Employer"'] and ERISA[/if] as it pertains to PHI, ePHI, and PII. Collectively this will be known as [if condition='q#120="Employer Group" || q#120="Medical/Dental Provider"']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120="Agency" || q#120="Business Associate"']Protected Data[/if].

$capitalize([q#2]) information may exist on paper, in voice systems, on IT systems[if condition='q#1729="Yes"'] and networks[/if], [if condition='q#7>=1']in the minds of employees, [/if]and in other forms. The information which needs protection includes, but is not limited to:

1. [if condition='q#120="Medical/Dental Provider"']Patient information[/if][if condition='q#120="Agency" || q#120="Business Associate" || q#120="Employer Group"']Client Information (both for client companies and for people as individuals)[/if];[if condition='q#7>=1']
1. Employee information (medical information of all types, social security numbers, personal data, background information, etc.);[/if]
1. Financial information (credit cards, salaries, banking, transactions, etc.);
1. Intellectual property ([if condition='q#120="Employer"']patents, [/if]business plans, records, planning materials, [if condition='q#120="Medical/Dental Provider"']patient lists[/if][if condition='q#120="Agency" || q#120="Business Associate" || q#120="Employer Group"']customer lists[/if], marketing, and sales efforts,[if condition='q#120="Agency" || q#120="Business Associate" || q#120="Employer Group"'] product line plans,[/if] etc.); and
1. Copyrighted materials (created, licensed, obtained, or purchased).

## 2. Definitions

_**Guidelines**:_ Built for each application and platform; to be followed when implementing that particular tool; a guideline may vary a bit from one implementation to another, as long as the security standards are met, and justification is given and properly documented.

_**Policies**:_ Documents which set out an entity’s position regarding business processes[if condition='q#7>=1'], behavior of employee,[/if] and similar topics; a high-level statement of position; some policies which relate to information security are the:

1.  Security Policy;[if condition='q#7>=1'] and[/if]
1.  Privacy Policy[if condition='q#7>=1'];
1.  Acceptable Use Policy for IT Systems Users; and
1.  Employment Policies[/if].

_**Standards**:_ Rules which must be followed to enable an effective information security program; compliance with the standards is mandatory, but deviation is possible if approved by the ISO.

1.  Standards define the minimum baseline procedures, practices, and configurations for systems, applications, controls, networks, and related topics. Standards are designed to provide a single reference point for use during software development and adoption, installation of systems and tools, and during the contracts process with vendors and service providers.
1.  Standards do not, however, give detailed command-line instructions on how to meet policies. Those are given in the guidelines.

Combined, these three levels of documents provide a method for an entity to audit itself and ensure proper controls are in place, without excess cost or risk. They also provide a means for the entity to explain to regulators, examiners, external auditors, or investors how the entity is safe, trustworthy, and efficient.

## 3. Policy
1. Compliance with these Standards is mandatory. 
1. Any deviation from these Standards must be approved beforehand by the ISO.

## 4. Key Concepts: Information Security Principles

The following must be taken under consideration when handling [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if]:

1. Confidentiality
1. Integrity
1. Availability
1. Provability
1. Balance risk against cost of controls

In this document, the Standards given are defaults. They must be applied where appropriate, but always balanced against the cost of implementing the control and the value of the information involved.

# III. Using These Standards

## 1. Overview—Who Will Use this Document

This document applies to [if condition='q#120=Agency']$the_noun([q#3])[else]employees[/if] and any Business Associate[if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate'] Subcontractor (BAS)[/if] supporting [q#2] that have access or potential access to [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if]:

1. Technology and business process providers should comply with these Standards as a matter of contractual obligation.[if condition='q#7>=1']
1. Everyone within [q#2] should comply unless a prior risk assessment has been done and a deviation is approved by the ISO.[/if]
1. Anyone implementing technologies within [q#2] should use this document as part of the requirement-setting process for the design of new tools and processes.

## 2. Definitions

_**Shall, Will, Mandatory, Must**:_ Mean the standard mentioned is a requirement and must be met.

_**Should, Recommended, Where Possible**:_ Indicate that the standard mentioned is a preferred and accepted control. Deviation may be possible if compensating controls are in place, a risk analysis of the deviation has been done and management signoff is obtained.

_**May, Optional**:_ Indicate that the standard mentioned is optional. Deviation does not require signoff or approval but is determined by the requirements of the implementation at hand. The implementation documentation should include a discussion of why the deviation was chosen so that future reviewers will have all needed information.

## 3.  Standards

This document is a reference point for use by [if condition='q#120=Agency']technology implementers and service providers[else][if condition='q#120=Employer || q#7>100']business units,[/if] technology implementers, and service providers[/if] to ensure a consistent framework of protection is in place. Implementing these standards involves:

1. Review of existing controls, procedures, and tools against the Standards;
1. Documenting deviations;
1. Gap analysis to determine where improvements are needed;
1. A Risk Assessment to validate that the improvements are justified against the costs of the controls and the value of the information involved;
1. Creation of a plan to close the gaps, or sign off on a deviation; and
1. Documentation of the new controls, procedures, and tools.

No signoff or approvals are needed if a level of protection higher than what is given in this Standard is determined to be needed for a given information asset.

## 4. Maintaining this Document

1. This  document must be reviewed by the ISO[if condition='q#14=Yes'] or designee[/if] at least once a year and updated to keep it in line with $possessive([q#2]) overall business goals and risk position.

# V. [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] Classifications and Requirements

## 1. Overview

[if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] is classified to ensure that the controls applied to it are sufficient and do not impair an entity's business, ability to compete, or image.

All [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] must have a classification for security and must have requirements set for business continuity (§§ 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A-E)). Data classification and business continuity requirements may be specified at the data set level or may be specified at the level of the system containing the [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if].

## 2. Definition

_**Data Set:**_ A collection of related sets of information; composed of separate elements but can be manipulated as a unit.
## 3. The Security Classification Process

[if condition='q#1728=Yes']
Security classifications are managed by [if condition='q#1728=Yes || q#709=Cloud Based || q#160=Cloud Backups || q#55=in the cloud']the [q#2] cloud provider, [q#189][/if].
[else]
1. Each information asset will be classified by the type of information they contain and/or come in contact with. Assets include, but are not limited to:
    1. IT platforms such as [if condition='q#703=Yes']servers and[/if] workstations;
    1. IT applications including database transaction processing and email;
    1. Data sets;[if condition='q#56=Yes']
    1. Paper copies of information;[/if]
    1. Information types typically known[if condition='q#7>=1'] to employees[/if], such as customer information.

1. In general, an information asset includes the raw information itself ([if condition='q#56=Yes']paper, [/if]oral or data entry), the location where it resides, the business processes, and the systems and tools which handle it.

    1. All information assets must be classified and reviewed at least once a year.
    1. Information assets will also be reviewed during:
        1. Development, acquisition, or deployment of software;
        1. Connections of computers or networks to outside systems or networks; and
        1. Granting of access to any outside organizations.
[/if]

## 4. The Classes of Information for Security and Privacy

$capitalize([q#2]) deals with two main kinds of data:
1.  _$capitalize([q#2])-Owned:_ Relates to such areas as [if condition='q#120=Employer']corporate [/if]financials, [if condition='q#7>=1']employment records, payroll, [/if]etc.
1. _Private:_ The property of [if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']clients[/if][if condition='q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']patients[/if][if condition='q#120=Employer Group']employees[/if], such as social security numbers, [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if], credit card information, contact information, etc.

[if condition='q#1728=Yes']
$capitalize([q#2]) data is comprised of four (4) classifications of information:

1. _Public/Unclassified_: This is defined as information that is generally available to anyone within or outside [q#2]. Access to this data is unrestricted, may already be available and can be distributed as needed. Public/unclassified data includes, but is not limited to, marketing materials, annual reports, corporate financials, and other data as applicable. Employees may send or communicate a public/unclassified piece of data with anyone inside or outside $the_noun([q#3]).
1. _Private/Internal_: This is defined as [q#2] information that is to be kept within $the_noun([q#3]). Access to this data may be limited to [if condition='q#120=Agency']employees[else]specific departments[/if] and cannot be distributed outside of the workplace. Private data includes, but is not limited to, [if condition='q#7>=7']work phone directories, [/if]organizational charts, [q#2] policies, and other data as applicable. All information not otherwise classified will be assumed to be Private. Employees may not disclose Private data to anyone who is not a current employee.
1.  _Confidential_: This is defined as personal or [q#2] information that may be considered potentially damaging if released and is only accessible to specific groups[if condition='q#7>20'] (e.g., payroll, HR, etc.)[/if]. Confidential data includes, but is not limited to, social security numbers, contact information, tax forms, accounting data, security procedures, and other data as applicable. $capitalize([q#2]) considers it a top priority to protect the privacy of [if condition='q#120=Agency']clients[/if][if condition='q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']patients[/if][if condition='q#120=Employer Group|| q#120=Business Associate']employees[/if]. Employees may only share confidential data within $the_noun([q#3]) or named distribution list.
1. _Protected_: This is defined as sensitive data which, if leaked, would be harmful to [q#2], its[if condition='q#120=Medical/Dental Provider'] patients,[/if] employees, agents, and other parties as applicable. Access is limited to authorized employees and third parties as required. [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] includes, but is not limited to, health information, audit reports, legal documentation, business strategy details, and other data as applicable. [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] cannot be disclosed by anyone other than the original author, owner, or distributor.
[/if]

## 5. Setting Requirements for Data Continuity

[if condition='q#1728=Yes']
Data continuity requirements are inherited from the [if condition='q#1728=Yes || q#709=Cloud Based || q#160=Cloud Backups || q#55=in the cloud'][q#2] cloud provider[/if].
[else]
The requirements for an information asset relating to operations continuity are specific to that asset. They include:
1. Required uptime for the information asset;
1. Required restoration time if the data must be restored;
1. Required frequency of backups;
1. Requirements for storage of backups; and
1. Requirements for testing of the recovery process.

Some requirements such as backup frequency, backup storage methodology, and backup recovery testing requirements may be specified as default values for all enterprise systems unless more restrictive values are specified for a specific information asset. The default requirements for business continuity are listed in the Information Handling Rules section below. [if condition='q#495=Yes']Refer to the _$capitalize([q#2]) Disaster Recovery Plan_.[else]See also Appendix B: Disaster and Emergency Plans for detailed information.[/if]
[/if]

## 6. Policy
[if condition='q#1728=Yes']
1. [/if]$capitalize([q#2]) will not knowingly accept any [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] belonging to third parties until that information is reviewed against [q#3] protections and the appropriate agreements put into place and signed by the information owner. The agreements should include all requirements for controls over the third-party information and the processes to be followed.[if condition='q#1728=Yes']
1. $capitalize([q#2]) depends on [if condition='q#1728=Yes || q#709=Cloud Based || q#160=Cloud Backups || q#55=in the cloud'] [q#189] for business and data continuity and inherits standards for protecting all data stored in the cloud from the cloud provider's platforms[/if].[/if]

# VI. Handling Rules for the Information Classifications

## 1. Overview

This section outlines the basic rules for handling information types according to the classifications. More specific standards for platforms, processes, and networks appear in each topic section of this standards document. [if condition='q#120=Employer || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']Covered Entities and their [/if]Business Associates must design handling rules to reasonably safeguard [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] from any intentional or unintentional use or disclosure that is in violation of the standards, implementation specifications, or other requirements of § 164.530(c\)(2)(i).

## 2. Inventory of Information Assets

[if condition='q#1728=Yes']
No [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] is stored locally on any devices; all [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] is stored with the cloud provider.
[else]

An inventory must be maintained of all significant information assets belonging to or used by [q#2]. This inventory must include:

1. Serial numbers/license numbers;
1. MAC addresses;
1. Model;
1. Device type;
1. Manufacturer;
1. The information owner;
1. Username;
1. Location;
1. Operating System (OS) version;
1. The custodian of the information and repository location (database[if condition='q#56=Yes'], file cabinet[/if], etc.);

1. The sensitivity of the asset due to regulations, laws, customer expectations, or other requirements;
1. Requirements for the asset regarding availability, uptime, etc.; and
1. Contact information for one or more parties who can repair, restore, replace, or recover this asset.

This inventory must be reviewed and updated annually. These logs are maintained as _Inventory of Information Assets_ and _Workstations Logs_. A current copy of this inventory will be kept at a separate location as described in the _$capitalize([q#2]) Disaster Recovery Plan_.
[/if]

# VIII. IDs and Accounts Policy

## 1. Overview

§ 164.308(a)(3), requires [if condition='q#120=Employer || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']Covered Entities and their [/if]Business Associates to implement procedures to ensure that [if condition='q#7>=1']users[else]employees [/if] have appropriate access to [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] and to prevent those who do not have access from obtaining it. Each user should be assigned a unique User ID to ensure that system activity can be traced to a specific user and the necessary data is available in the system logs to support audit and other related business functions as required under §§ 164.312(a)(2)(i), (b), and (d).

## 2. Definitions

_**Access Control**:_ Process that limits and controls access to resources of a computer system.

_**Access Privileges**:_ Systems permissions associated with an account, including permissions to access or change data, to process transactions, create or change settings, etc.

# XI. Risk Analysis and Management

## 1. Overview

Risks to an organization's assets and environment should be addressed proactively rather than reactively. The controls applied to the risks must also be periodically reviewed to ensure the controls are working properly and efficiently.

As required by § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(a), an organization must conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if].

Risks may be accepted, avoided, or mitigated when:

1. Accepting the risk is appropriate when the cost of avoiding or mitigating the risk is greater than the expected loss. The losses considered should include the less tangible items such as reputation, loss of market share, and loss of public trust.
1. Avoiding the risk is appropriate when the cost of insurance is less than the cost of incremental controls. However, basic controls must always be in place.
1. Mitigating the risk is appropriate in most situations. These situations are those where compensating controls are possible, cost-effective, and manageable. These mitigating controls may include:
    1. Increasing protection to a level higher than what is listed in this document;
    1. Improving oversight or monitoring of the risk to limit impact and minimize response time; and
    1. Limiting transactions or other events to minimize the possible impact of the risk event.

## 2. Policy
The ISO or designee will review the Risk Assessment at least annually to ensure it is accurate and thorough and update as needed.

## 3. Risk Reviews
The ISO or designee is required to review risks and set requirements for controls. Risks should be reviewed or assessed when:

1. Developing or deploying new applications[if condition='q#1728=Yes'], systems, networks, or software[/if];
1. Significant changes are made to that same list;
1. Business processes change significantly;
1. $capitalize([q#2]) enters a new geographical area of business;[if condition='q#120=Agency']
1. $capitalize([q#2]) enters a new line of business;[/if]
1. Incidents occur or new risks emerge; or
1. New regulations or standards are set.

The method chosen for managing the risk (acceptance, avoidance, mitigation) must match the business value and costs involved and must be approved by the information owner.

# XXIII. Physical Device Security

## 1. Overview
To comply with §§ 164.310(a)(2)(i) and (ii), [if condition='q#120=Employer || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']Covered Entities and their [/if]Business Associates are responsible for maintaining an inventory of devices and, as such, shall employ software to aid in the management of hardware and software assets. Regardless of their location, onsite or remote, these must be secured in a manner that prevents them from being physically accessed without the appropriate level of security clearance.

## 2. Definitions
[if condition='q#369=Yes']
_**Server**:_ Device that may or may not be housed onsite; regardless of location, they must be secured in a manner that prevents them from being physically accessed without the appropriate level of security clearance.[/if]

_**Workstations**:_ PCs, desktop computers, tablets, and mobile computing devices located onsite, at a home office, or at remote locations; they are easily attacked and therefore must have access controls and anti-malware as specified in those sections of this document.

## 3. Policy
1. A current copy of the inventory of devices and a software log will be kept at an offsite location, so it can be accessed quickly in the case of theft, fire, flood, or other events where it may be useful.
1. The ISO will ensure that a log of events is kept, noting when a device is repaired, replaced, installed, removed, modified, or maintained. This log will contain the who, what, when, where, and why of the change and be kept in the SDL.
1. [if condition='q#7>=1']The ISO will[else]Users of these devices are required to[/if] ensure that all appropriate protections are in place, including:
    1. Physical security to prevent theft or misuse;
    1. Anti-malware;
    1. Keeping the devices locked to a desk or other secure location when outside $the_noun([q#3]); and
    1. Ensuring that the transport of these devices is secure and is safe from damage - for example, these devices should only travel in an appropriate case and should be locked and shut down during transit.  
1. Devices of these types that are owned by [if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']BASs[else]BAs[/if], vendors, or other third parties must meet all [q#2] requirements prior to being connected. 

# XXIV. Firewalls and Network Configuration

## 1. Overview

Although § 164.312(c)(1) requiring[if condition='q#120=Employer || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider'] Covered Entities and their[/if] Business Associates to protect [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']ePHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']electronic Protected Data[/if] doesn’t specifically mention firewalls, the security standards on which HIPAA is based detail what controls need to be in place to protect [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']ePHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']electronic Protected Data[/if] from improper use, disclosure, or destruction. Since a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, they are an essential component of all information systems security infrastructure. They establish a control point where access controls may be enforced.

## 2. Definitions

[if condition='q#262=Software || q#262=Both'] _**Host Firewall**:_ A software application that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. Examples include but are not limited to Symantec’s Norton Personal Firewall, Zone Labs’ ZoneAlarm, or native firewall functionality supplied under operating systems, e.g., macOS, Linux, Windows 8 (and higher).[/if][if condition='q#262=Hardware || q#262=Both']

_**Network Firewall**:_ A hardware device built into a router or a stand-alone appliance that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. All computing devices will access a network through this point.[/if]

_**Network Hardening**:_ Usually the process of securing a system by reducing available ways of attack; typically includes the removal of unnecessary software, usernames or logins, and the disabling or removal of unnecessary services.

## 3. Policy
[if condition='q#7>=1']
1. [/if]This policy applies to all firewalls on [q#2] networks[if condition='q#7>=1'], whether owned, rented, leased, or otherwise controlled or managed by [if condition='q#221=Both']employees and/or third parties[else][if condition='q#221=In-house IT Team']employees[else][if condition='q#221=IT Vendor || q#221=Both']third parties[/if][/if][/if][/if]. 
1. $capitalize([q#2]) has installed secure [if condition='q#262=Software']host[/if][if condition='q#262=Hardware']network[/if][if condition='q#262=Both']host and network[/if] firewalls at all data access points.[if condition='q#7>=1']
    1. [/if]Firewall specifications are documented and stored in the $possessive([q#3]) SDL.[if condition='q#7>=1']
    1. Departures from this policy will be permitted only if approved in writing by the ISO.
1. In some instances, systems such as routers, air gaps, telecommunications front ends, or gateways may be functioning as though they are firewalls when they are not formally known as firewalls. All [q#2] systems playing the role of firewalls, whether or not they are formally called firewalls, must be managed according to the rules defined in this policy. In some instances, this will require that these systems be upgraded so that they support the minimum functionality defined in this policy. [if condition='q#451=Zero (0)']The ISO is[/if][if condition='q#451=One (1)']The $get_contact_title([q#452]) and the ISO are[/if][if condition='q#451=Two (2)']The $get_contact_title([q#452]), $get_contact_title([q#453]), and the ISO are[/if][if condition='q#451=Three (3)'] The $get_contact_title([q#452]), $get_contact_title([q#453]), $get_contact_title([q#454]), and the ISO are[/if][if condition='q#451=Four (4)']The $get_contact_title([q#452]), $get_contact_title([q#453]), $get_contact_title([q#454]), $get_contact_title([q#455]), and the ISO are[/if][if condition='q#451=Five (5)']The $get_contact_title([q#452]), $get_contact_title([q#453]), $get_contact_title([q#454]), $get_contact_title([q#455]), $get_contact_title([q#456]), and the ISO are[/if] responsible for monitoring software and system upgrades.
[/if][if condition='q#7>2']
## 4. Logging Policy
1. Network logs include:[if condition='q#263=Yes']
1. [q#264].[/if][if condition='q#263=No']
    1. When anyone logs in by username and IP address;
    1. The number of failed logins attempted on a computer;

    1. Who downloaded a new program, and when;
    1. When a user changes their password;
    1. What information was accessed by the person logged in; and
    1. What [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] was changed and by whom.[/if]
1. The [if condition='q#1728=Yes'][q#189][else][if condition='q#265=Other'][q#266][else][q#265][/if][/if] is in charge of ensuring that these logs are reviewed[if condition='q#1728!=Yes'] $lower_case([q#698])[/if].
1. $capitalize([q#2]) maintains network logs for [if condition='q#273=Under Six Years']fewer than six years[else]a minimum of six years[/if].[/if]

## 5. Specific Requirements

1. [u]Default to Denial or Whitelist:[/u] Every connectivity path and service that is not specifically permitted by this policy and supporting documents issued by the ISO must be blocked by [q#2] firewalls. The list of currently approved paths and services must be documented and distributed to all system administrators with a need to know by the ISO or designee.
1. [u]External Connections:[/u] [if condition='q#1729=Yes']No computer system accessing [q#2] [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] [else]All in-bound, real-time Internet connections to [q#2] internal networks or multi-user computer systems must pass through a firewall before users can reach a logon banner. No [q#2] computer system [/if]may be attached to the Internet unless it is protected by a firewall.[if condition='q#277=Yes']
1. [u]Intrusion Detection:[/u] All [q#2] firewalls must include intrusion detection systems approved by the ISO. Among other potential problems, these intrusion detection systems must detect unauthorized modifications to firewall system files and detect denial of service attacks in progress.[/if]
1. [u]Regular Testing:[/u] Because firewalls provide such an important control measure for [q#2] networks, their strength and proper configuration must be tested on a regular basis.

## 6. Network Connection

[if condition='q#7>=1']$capitalize([q#2]) connects[else]Employees connect[/if] to the network through a $lower_case([q#275]).  [if condition='q#275=Wireless && q#285=Yes']The wireless network is encrypted using WPA2-AES.[/if]

[if condition='q#262=Hardware || q#262=Both']
## 6. Network Firewall

1. [u]Disclosure of Internal Network Information:[/u] The internal system addresses, configurations, products deployed, and related system design information for [q#2] networked computer systems must be restricted such that both systems and users outside the [q#3] internal network cannot access this information.
1. [u]Firewall Access Mechanisms:[/u] All [q#2] firewalls must have unique passwords or other access control mechanisms. The same password or access control code must not be used on more than one firewall. Whenever supported by the involved firewall vendor, those who administer [q#3] firewalls must have their identity validated through extended user authentication mechanisms.
1. [u]Firewall Access Privileges:[/u] Privileges to modify the functionality, connectivity, and services supported by firewalls must be restricted to a few technically trained individuals with a business need for these same privileges. [if condition='q#7>=1'] All firewalls should have at least two employees or authorized [if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']BASs[else]BAs[/if] who are adequately trained to make changes, as circumstances require.[/if]
1. [u]Posting Updates:[/u] Firewalls must be running the latest release of software to repel attacks. Where available from the involved vendor, all [q#2] firewalls must subscribe to software and firmware update services.
1. [u]Secure Backup:[/u] Current offline back-up copies of firewall configuration files, connectivity permission files, firewall systems administration procedural documentation files, and related files must be kept close to the firewall at all times. A permissible alternative to offline copies involves online encrypted versions of these same files. Where systems software permits it, the automatic reestablishment of approved copies of these systems files must proceed whenever an unauthorized modification to these files has been detected.[if condition='q#7>=1']
1. [u]Secured Subnets:[/u] Portions of the internal network that contain sensitive or valuable information, such as the computers used by the Human Resources/Benefits department, should employ a secured subnet. Access to this and other subnets should be restricted with firewalls or other access control measures. Based on periodic risk assessments, the ISO will define the secured subnets required in the Information Architecture.[/if][if condition='q#344=Yes']
1.  [u]Virtual Private Networks (VPN)[/u]: To prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and valuable information, all inbound traffic, with the exception of Internet mail, approved news services, and push broadcasts that access [q#2] networks, must be encrypted with the products approved by the ISO. These connections are often called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The VPNs permissible on the networks combine extended user authentication functionality with communications encryption functionality.[/if]
1. [u]Virus Screening and Content Screening[/u]: Virus screening software approved by the information technology provider must be installed and enabled on all firewalls. Because the files passing through a firewall may be encrypted or compressed, firewall-based virus detection systems may not detect all virus-infected files. For this reason, virus screening software is also required at all [q#2] firewalls.[/if][if condition='q#344=Yes']
## 7. VPN

The VPN is configured internally by the [if condition='q#350=Yes']ISO[else]$get_contact_title([q#351])[/if][if condition='q#341=Yes'], and access points are tested [if condition='q#343=Other']$lower_case([q#343])[else]$lower_case([q#343])[/if][/if].

Users are registered by the [if condition='q#348=Yes']ISO[else]$get_contact_title([q#349])[/if].[/if]
[if condition='q#262=Software|| q#262=Both']
## 8. Host Firewall

$capitalize([q#2]) requires that devices have a host firewall activated at all times and set to default to denial or whitelist. This will require the user to authorize any connections to their device.[/if]

## 9. Network Hardening

1. Upon adding new devices to the network, installation procedures and set-up must be followed.
1. Hardening will be done on network devices as well as systems (e.g., laptops, workstations[if condition='q#369=Yes'], and servers[/if]) and handled by the ISO or an approved designee, whenever there needs to be:

    1. Preparation and installation;
    1. Updates to software, firmware, and hardware;
    1. Setting of appropriate account and auditing rules;
    1. Setting of appropriate security rules;
    1. Turning on or installing host firewall application;
    1. Turning on full disk encryption (if device will have access to [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if]); or
    1. Other internal operations such as installation of appropriate software for workstation[if condition='q#369=Yes'], server,[/if] or laptop.

[if condition='q#7>=1']
1. The ISO will notify all affected employees when making changes to the hardening policy and will update these Security Policies and Procedures at that time. Written approval for hardening procedures above and beyond what is currently mandated is not necessary.[/if]

# XXV. Physical Access and Environmental Security Policy

Once the restored data has been verified once more, the “old data” will be destroyed.[/if]

## 7. Emergency Operations Plan
[if condition='q#495=Yes']Refer to the $capitalize([q#2]) Disaster Recovery Plan. [else]
1. When the [q#2] system is unavailable:
    1. The ISO will activate the Disaster Recovery Plan; [if condition='q#56=Yes']

 [/if][/if]

## 9. Backup Retention
[if condition='q#160=Cloud Backups']The $possessive([q#3]) backup retention policy is inherited from [q#189]. Refer to [q#190].[else]
Backup cycles are defined for daily, weekly, monthly and annual periods. A daily-generation full daily backup cycle involves retaining seven sets of backups (one week, SSMTWTF). Then the seventh daily backup is retained for one month, as part of a weekly backup cycle. The fourth weekly backup is retained for one year as part of a monthly backup cycle. End of fiscal year and yearly archive data backups should be generated in multiple copies and each copy stored in a distinct archive storage location. In this way, the risk of catastrophic loss is minimized at a reasonable media cost.

Backups will be maintained for a minimum of [if condition='q#160=Cloud Backups || q#160=Backups To A Server || q#160=Backups To Removable Media (Hard drives, Tapes, DVDs, Memory Sticks)'][q#176] or [/if]30 days. End of year backups of [if condition='q#120=Employer Group || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']PHI[/if][if condition='q#120=Agency || q#120=Business Associate']Protected Data[/if] will be maintained for six years for statutory purposes.

The ISO [if condition='q#7>=1']or designee[/if] shall maintain a log of all backups undertaken. Logs of backups will be maintained for six years from the date the backup was executed for statutory purposes.[/if]

# XXX. Security Incident Management Policy

## 1. Overview
The Security Incident Procedures standard at § 164.308(a)(6)(i) requires [if condition='q#120=Employer || q#120=Medical/Dental Provider']Covered Entities and their [/if]Business Associates to implement policies and procedures to address security incidents. The associated implementation specification for response and reporting at § 164.308(a)(6)(ii) requires an organization to identify and respond to suspected or known security incidents, mitigate, to the extent practicable, harmful effects of security incidents that are known, and document security incidents and their outcomes. 

## 2. Policy

[if condition='q#7>=1']
1. To manage these incidents, [q#2] will train each employee to recognize the common telltale signs of a security incident. When an employee detects one of these signs, they will be responsible for notifying [if condition='q#7>11']their manager or [/if]the ISO.[if condition='q#1728=No']
1. The ISO will maintain a set of tests to detect events in the system logs that may indicate security incidents. These tests will be conducted using a combination of various software tools run against the system log on a daily basis or whenever needed. The tests currently are:
    1. Account creation/deletion;
    1. High volume of unsuccessful login attempts;
    1. Alerts from malware monitoring systems;
    1. High volume of file or database access/creation/deletion activity for the time of day, or for day of the week;
    1. Account activity at unusual times of the day or night;
    1. Absence of expected log records of activity when expected;
    1. Unusual level of record access for a given account; and
    1. Account lockout due to excessive password retry failure.
1. Daily logs will be reviewed as needed.
1. When anomalies are discovered, the script will provide a report that is immediately brought to the attention of the ISO or designee as a potential security incident.[/if][/if]
1. The ISO will determine[if condition='q#7>=1 || q#221=IT Vendor'], in consultation with [if condition='q#1728=Yes']the cloud provider[else]others[/if] if needed,[/if] whether an event is a security incident.
1. The ISO[if condition='q#7>=1'] or designee[/if] will refer to the Breach Worksheet to determine the extent of the incident and what information has been compromised.

## 3. Containment

1. To prevent further intrusion or damage, the ISO[if condition='q#7>=1'] or designee[/if] may need to[if condition='q#1729=Yes'] change passwords.[else]:

    1. Disconnect the affected system(s);
    1. Change passwords;
    1. Block ports or connections from IP addresses.[/if]
1. To prevent re-infection, the ISO[if condition='q#7>=1'] or designee[/if] will take the following steps:
    1. Determine how the intrusion happened, and the source — whether it was email, inadequate training, or an attack through a port or unneeded service and/or due to an unpatched system or application;[if condition='q#1729=Yes']
    1. Close a port on a firewall;
    1. Patch the affected system;
    1. Shut down the infected system until it can be re-installed;
    1. Re-install the infected system and restore data from backup. Be sure the backup was made before the infection;[/if]
    1. Change email settings as needed;[if condition='q#7>=1']
    1. Train users;[/if] and
    1. Disable unused services on the affected system.

## 4. Restoration of Affected Systems

1. Once it has been determined how the attack or intrusion came about, [if condition='q#196=No || q#193=No']the ISO [if condition='q#12=IT Vendor']or IT Vendor[/if][/if][if condition='q#197=One']the ISO and $get_contact_title([q#198])[/if][if condition='q#197=Two']the ISO, $get_contact_title([q#198]), and $get_contact_title([q#199])[/if][if condition='q#197=Three']the ISO, $get_contact_title([q#198]), $get_contact_title([q#199]), and $get_contact_title([q#200]) [/if][if condition='q#197=Four']the ISO, $get_contact_title([q#198]), $get_contact_title([q#199]), $get_contact_title([q#200]), and $get_contact_title([q#201]) [/if][if condition='q#197=Five']the ISO, $get_contact_title([q#198]), $get_contact_title([q#199]), $get_contact_title([q#200]), $get_contact_title([q#201]), $get_contact_title([q#202])[/if] will restore affected systems to their original state, being sure to preserve evidence against the intruder[if condition='q#1728=Yes'] by backing up logs, or possibly the entire system[/if]. 
1. Depending on the situation, restoring the system could include one or more of the following:
    1. Re-installing the affected system(s) from scratch and restore data from backups;
    1. Changing user passwords;
    1. Hardening systems by turning off or uninstalling unused services;
    1. Patching software and systems; and
    1. Running real-time virus and intrusion detection.

# XXXI. Security Plan Review Policy

## 1. Overview
Underlying security risks will change and the ability to manage risks will improve over time.

## 2. Procedures
1. _[q#2]  Security Policies and Procedures_ will be reviewed annually. 
    1. The ISO will lead this review and involve others as needed
    1. Documentation of the review will be contained in a document called _Annual Security Review_ and stored in the Security Documentation Library.
1. At a minimum, the review process will consist of:
    1. Evaluating changes in the last year that may affect $the_noun($possessive([q#3])) Security Policy. These will include changes in:
        1. Number, sizes, or locations of [q#3] business sites;
        1. Number of employees composition; [if condition='q#120=Agency']
        1. Type of medical insurance;[/if]
        1. Hardware/software; and
        1. State or federal laws.
    1. Reading each policy to determine how the changes may affect the practices driven by the policy.
    1. Creating a list of changes in policies and/or procedures that $the_noun([q#3]) will carry out.
    1. Developing and implementing any changes in Policies and Procedures on a timely basis.
